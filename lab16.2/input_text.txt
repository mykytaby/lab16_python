Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It involves tasks like speech recognition, text analysis, translation, and sentiment analysis. NLP techniques are used in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and social media monitoring. Despite significant progress, NLP remains a challenging problem, with issues like ambiguity and context sensitivity.
